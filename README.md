# ASCII Forever

Django site powering the text art platform www.asciiforever.net.

## Roadmap

My actual To-Do list reads like an incarnation to summon demons, so to avoid any more incidents I'll just briefly summarise my plans for the siteâ€”

* Rich text
* Animated text
* Responsive web design
* Notifications system
* ... and many more minor tweaks

Rich text could initially be supported by accepting text files with ANSI escape codes, and likewise animated text could be specified as delimited text files. A long-term project would be an in-browser editor so that these features would be much more accessible for the average user.

There are tons of smaller features I'll like to see which would improve the AF experience. Along with better support for non-desktop devices and social features, I'll just be iteratively implementing things and seeing how they play out. Watch this space!
